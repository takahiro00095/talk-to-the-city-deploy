Many participants voiced worries about the misuse of taxpayer money, the potential for accidents (especially related to methane gas), and the accessibility of the venue. While some defended the Expo's potential benefits, a substantial portion advocated for cancellation or postponement, citing these risks and questioning the event's value. Criticisms also extended to the perceived negativity surrounding the Expo and the reliability of cashless payment systems.","config":{"name":"takahiro_abe","question":"大阪・関西万博ニュースコメント分析","input":"expo-osaka","model":"gemini-2.0-flash","extraction":{"workers":3,"limit":1000,"source_code":"import os\nimport json\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport pandas as pd\n# from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\nfrom langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI\nfrom utils import messages, update_progress\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport re\nfrom steps.share.llm import invoke_llm\n\n\"\"\"\nユーザーコメント（CSVファイル）を読み込み、大規模言語モデル（LLM、例えばGPT）を使って、各コメントに含まれる個別の「意見」や「論点」（引数: argument）を抽出し、その結果を新しいCSVファイルに保存する\n\"\"\"\n\ndef extraction(config):\n    dataset = config['output_dir']\n    path = f\"outputs/{dataset}/args.csv\"\n    # inputフォルダからCSVファイルを読み込む\n    comments = pd.read_csv(f\"inputs/{config['input']}.csv\")\n\n    model = config['extraction']['model']\n    prompt = config['extraction']['prompt']\n    workers = config['extraction']['workers']\n    limit = config['extraction']['limit']\n\n    # 処理対象のコメントIDリストを作成する\n    comment_ids = (comments['comment-id'].values)[:limit]\n    comments.set_index('comment-id', inplace=True)\n    results = pd.DataFrame()\n    update_progress(config, total=len(comment_ids))\n    for i in tqdm(range(0, len(comment_ids), workers)):\n        batch = comment_ids[i: i + workers]\n        batch_inputs = [comments.loc[id]['comment-body'] for id in batch]\n        batch_results = extract_batch(config, batch_inputs, prompt, model, workers)\n        for comment_id, extracted_args in zip(batch, batch_results):\n            for j, arg in enumerate(extracted_args):\n                new_row = {\"arg-id\": f\"A{comment_id}_{j}\",\n                           \"comment-id\": int(comment_id), \"argument\": arg}\n                results = pd.concat(\n                    [results, pd.DataFrame([new_row])], ignore_index=True)\n        update_progress(config, incr=len(batch))\n    results.to_csv(path, index=False)\n\n\ndef extract_batch(config, batch, prompt, model, workers):\n    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=workers) as executor:\n        futures = [executor.submit(\n            extract_arguments, config, input, prompt, model) for input in list(batch)]\n        concurrent.futures.wait(futures)\n        return [future.result() for future in futures]\n\n\ndef extract_arguments(config, input, prompt, model, retries=3):\n    message = messages(prompt, input)\n    response = invoke_llm(config, message)\n\n    # json出力を捕縛する\n    match = re.search(r\"```json\\s*([\\s\\S]*?)\\s*```\", response, re.IGNORECASE)\n    if match:\n        json_string = match.group(1).strip() # JSON部分を抽出して前後の空白を除去\n    else:\n        # コードブロックがない場合、そのまま使う (ただし、他の不要なテキストがないか注意)\n        json_string = response\n\n    print(json_string)\n    try:\n        obj = json.loads(json_string)\n        # LLM sometimes returns valid JSON string\n        if isinstance(obj, str):\n            obj = [obj]\n        items = [a.strip() for a in obj]\n        items = filter(None, items)  # omit empty strings\n        return items\n    except json.decoder.JSONDecodeError as e:\n        print(\"JSON error:\", e)\n        print(\"Input was:\", input)\n        print(\"Response was:\", json_string)\n        if retries > 0:\n            print(\"Retrying...\")\n            return extract_arguments(config, input, prompt, model, retries - 1)\n        else:\n            print(\"Silently giving up on trying to generate valid list.\")\n            return []\n","prompt":"/system\n\nYou are a professional research assistant and your job is to help \nme prepare a nice and clean datasets of arguments. \n\nI'm going to give you examples of arguments that were contributed by the public and I want you \nto help me make them more concise and easy to read.
